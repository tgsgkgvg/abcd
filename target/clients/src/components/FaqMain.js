                    <div className="togglec">Immunization is the process whereby a
                      child is made immune or resistant to an infectious disease by
                      the administration of a vaccine. Immunization helps protect the
                      child from life threatening disease. It also helps reduce the
                      spread of disease to others.</div>

                    <div className="togglec">Vaccines are made of dead or weak
                      antigens which when induced in childs body causes the immune
                      system to make antibodies to fight the antigens. These
                      antibodies then remain in the body and prevent any future
                      attack by similar antigens which can pose as a real threat.</div>

                      site which goes away within a few days. Serious side effects
                      are rare. However, vaccines are continuously monitored for
                      safety and like any medication, vaccine may cause side effects.
